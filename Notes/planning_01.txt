Stream of consciousness planning:
The program will have a GUI that allows all functions to be controlled graphically
The relevant functions include: creating protocols, viewing protocol details, NOT deleting protocols (to prevent accidents. They can be deleted from the files, also there should
be statistics about protocol usage) (creating protocols could involve using another as a template), also includes: viewing raw data, deciding how data is processed, processing
data, also checking the status of connected equipment. Also needs to include setting up the experiment and running the experiment
Will need to change pages
Running the experiment will involve a much different program structure than the menu pages
Running the experiment will need to carry out many processes that occur at different rates
These processes can be managed using multi-threading or processed in series. I think multithreading is the best bet 
Now I need to consider the best way to manage user interfaces knowing what I now know
Each window has unique processes to that window so processes and UI stuff should be kept in one script
Each script has a startup function and a function that runs continuously while on that page
